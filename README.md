# Kaggle-M5-Competition

## Objective

The objective of the M5 forecasting competition is to advance the theory and practice of <br />forecasting by identifying the method(s) that provide the most accurate point forecasts for <br />each of the 42,840 time series of the competition. I addition, to elicit information to <br />estimate the uncertainty distribution of the realized values of these series as precisely as <br />possible. <br />
To that end, the participants of M5 are asked to provide 28 days ahead point forecasts (PFs) <br />for all the series of the competition, as well as the corresponding median and 50%, 67%, <br />95%, and 99% prediction intervals (PIs).<br />
The M5 differs from the previous four ones in five important ways, some of them suggested by <br />the discussants of the M4 competition, as follows:<br />
* First, it uses grouped unit sales data, starting at the product-store level and being <br />aggregated to that of product departments, product categories, stores, and three <br />geographical areas: the States of California (CA), Texas (TX), and Wisconsin (WI).
* Second, besides the time series data, it includes explanatory variables such as sell <br />prices, promotions, days of the week, and special events (e.g. Super Bowl, Valentineâ€™s <br />Day, and Orthodox Easter) that typically affect unit sales and could improve <br />forecasting accuracy.
* Third, in addition to point forecasts, it assesses the distribution of uncertainty, as <br />the participants are asked to provide information on nine indicative quantiles.
* Fourth, instead of having a single competition to estimate both the point forecasts and <br />the uncertainty distribution, there will be two parallel tracks using the same dataset, <br />the first requiring 28 days ahead point forecasts and the second 28 days ahead <br />probabilistic forecasts for the median and four prediction intervals (50%, 67%, 95%, <br />and 99%).
* Fifth, for the first time it focuses on series that display intermittency, i.e., sporadic <br />demand including zeros.
